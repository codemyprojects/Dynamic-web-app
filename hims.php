<h3>Shelter project </h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify; color:#003333;">HIMS Nepal has trained 308 masons in earthquake-resilient infrastructure construction. They have completed two demo houses and further construction using local materials has commenced so that the community can observe the new construction techniques and use the trained masons in house reconstruction. 2669 community people have received the 2nd instalment for their housing construction from the National Reconstruction Authority.</p>

    <h3>Disaster Risk Reduction Project</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify; color:#003333;"> In North Dhading, there is high risk of disaster because of its remote geographical location and lack of awareness. In the 2015 earthquake infrastructure was totally destroyed and the Disaster Risk Reduction Project is looking at disaster prevention and risk reduction including prevention activities like light search and rescue training, first aid training, emergency shelter home construction, climate change and environment protection activities.</p>

    <h3>Protection Project</h3>
   
   <p style="text-align:justify; color:#003333;">The protection programme focuses on children, particularly those who have become homeless, and senior citizens who face difficulties surviving. HIMS has implemented activities for child protection which support peer educators, dysfunctional child clubs and teaching material supply.</p>

    <h3>Psycho social and Trauma Healing</h3>
   
   <p style="text-align:justify; color:#003333;">Many people have experienced trauma from the earthquake events. HIMS Nepal is involved in screening them for trauma and awareness activities for school children. Sports materials have been supplied to schools and try to minimize children's trauma through enjoyable activities such as sports, dance, singing, games and storytelling.</p>

    <h3>Good Governance</h3>
   
   <p style="text-align:justify; color:#003333;">Ward Citizen Forum coordinators and social mobilisers have received training in good governance. Through health posts they have made an action plan in order to address the queries and responses of the community to become more accountable. A feedback mechanism has been established with suggestion boxes installed in field and district offices as well as hoarding boards. The Local Development Officer has encouraged other NGOs to establish this feedback system in their working areas.</p>

    <h3>Community Infrastructure and Hydropower Project</h3>
   
   <p style="text-align:justify; color:#003333;">In the earthquake of 2015, in Ree and Jharlang, almost all drinking water systems, and toilets (individual and public) have been destroyed and community people have been suffering from various health related problems resulting in hygiene problems and dropouts from schools. HIMS Nepal has started to work on the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme and construction and reconstruction of different schemes for communal use.</p>
